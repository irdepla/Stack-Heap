1. Loops
Loops are control structures that allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. Common types of loops in programming include:

For Loop: Iterates a specific number of times. Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code to execute
}
While Loop: Continues to execute as long as a condition is true. Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // code to execute
}
Do While Loop: Executes at least once before checking the condition. Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
do {
    // code to execute
} while (condition);
2. Types of Functions
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. Types of functions include:

Regular Functions: Standard way to define a function. Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to execute
}
Anonymous Functions: Functions without a name, often used in callbacks. Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
const myFunc = function(parameters) {
    // code to execute
};
Arrow Functions: Shorter syntax for writing functions, introduced in ES6. Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
const myFunc = (parameters) => {
    // code to execute
};
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them. E.g., map, filter, reduce.

3. Stack and Heap Memory
Memory management in programming is critical for efficient resource usage. Two primary areas are:

Stack:

Stores function calls, local variables, and control flow.
Operates in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.
Memory allocation is automatic and faster.
Limited size; usually leads to stack overflow if exceeded (e.g., deep recursion).
Heap:

Used for dynamic memory allocation, where variables are allocated and freed as needed.
Size is generally larger than the stack, but allocation is slower and requires manual management (e.g., using malloc and free in C).
Memory fragmentation can occur, leading to inefficient use of memory.
